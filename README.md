# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-LogReg
This repository contains the machine learning project based on the credit card fault detection dataset.Logistic Regression is the model used here to predict the model's accuracy.
The given dataset is a classic example of classification problems in supervised machine learning.The dataset has uneven number of label quantity,so confusion matrix would not play a role here to calculate the score.To efficiently calculate the accuarcy score,the Receiver Operating Characteristic(ROC) curve and the area under the curve(AUC) has been used.
The ROC-AUC-Score comes around 0.97 which is quite efficient.
